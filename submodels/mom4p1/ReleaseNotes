Dear MOM4p1 community,

We wish to release a patch for the MOM4p1 version originally released
on 30Sep2007.  This patch provides a complete update to the code and
tests.  The following release notes provide a summary of the elements
to the patch.  If these changes do not affect you, then please retain
your original code base.  Otherwise, we recommend updating when you
find an opportune time.

We wish you a happy 2008,
  Stephen Griffies, Niki Zadeh, and the MOM4 team


****************************************************************
MODIFIED CODE for mom4p1_28Dec2007, relative to mom4p1_30sep2007

mom4p1/ocean_core/ocean_advection_velocity.F90
 A diagnostic for "wt" in the original mom4p1 distribution was
computed by the division wrho_bt/rho. This calculation may encounter
divisions by zero.  The updated version computes this diagnostic in a
do-loop with masking to avoid division by zero.

mom4p1/ocean_core/ocean_grids.F90
 The indices ioff and joff were missing from some of the grid arrays
for the mosaic grids.  This mistake caused the static cpp preprocessor
option MOM4_STATIC_MEMORY to be wrong when using a mosaic grid spec
file.  NOTE that mosaic grids are still experimental in MOM4p1.

ocean_core/ocean_topog.F90
 An option was added to modify the kmt array according to nml
parameters.

ocean_core/ocean_model.F90
 Change modifies the manner in which the diagnostic tracer
"irradiance" is initialized.  This change is needed in order to
correct a bug related to running with prognostic biogeochemistry in
ocean_topaz.F90.

mom4p1/ocean_core/ocean_obc.F90
 Peng Yu found a sign error in subroutine phase_speed_MILLER on lines
4785-4787. The bug fix was reported to the MOM4p1 email list.

original code: 
r1 = eta(i2,j2,tau) + eta(i1,j1,tau)
r2 = eta_taum1(i1,j1) + eta_taum1(i,j)
r3 = eta_taum1(i2,j2) + eta_taum1(i1,j1)

corrected code:
r1 = eta(i2,j2,tau) - eta(i1,j1,tau)
r2 = eta_taum1(i1,j1) - eta_taum1(i,j)
r3 = eta_taum1(i2,j2) - eta_taum1(i1,j1).

The correction is based on the reference "M.J. and Thorpe, A.J.,
1981. Radiation conditions for the lateral boundaries of limited-area
numerical models. /Quart. J. R. Met. Soc./ *107*, pp. 615?628".

mom4p1/ocean_tracers/ocean_tracer_advect.F90
 flux_z in the function advect_tracer_mdppm had
 two sign errors, which did not cancel.  The result
 of the errors was spuriously strong gradients, which
 led to choppy tracer features.  The bug fix corrects
 these problems.

ocean_tracers/ocean_tracer.F90
 Move the call to initialize the diagnostic tracer "irradiance" into
T_diag function.

mom4p1/ocean_bgc/ocmip2_cfc.F90
 send_data called on the wrong field for one of the diagnostics.

ocean_bgc/ocean_topaz.F90
 Updated algorithm and corrected bugs from John Dunne. 

mom4p1/ocean_param/ocean_vert_mix_chen.F90
 Russ Fiedler corrected bugs related to MOM4p1's use of mass based
rather than volume based equations. There were factors of rho
incorrect in the original MOM4p1 version of this module. 

mom4p1/ocean_params/sources/ocean_shortwave_gfdl.F90
 A bug was corrected bug with the Manizza etal optics.  There was a
spurious extra exponential in the vertical radiation profile.

ocean_diag/ocean_tracer_util.F90
 Added to printout some more grid information describing points of
maximum and minimum tracer and thickness.


=======================================================================

shared/mpp/include/mpp_do_update_new_ad.h 
shared/mpp/include/mpp_do_updateV_new_ad.h
 The original code had lines longer than 132 columns, which fails to
compile on NEC compilers.

shared/fms/fms_io.F90
shared/fms/fms.F90
 Updates for mosaic grids (still experimental in MOM4p1)

=======================================================================

Harper Simmons provided a corrected csh build script for
test_time_interp_ext. The driver script has been distributed in broken
form for years.

preprocessing/test_time_interp_ext/test_time_interp_ext.csh

=======================================================================

Martin Schmidt provided an enhancement for postprocessing tool mppnccombine
which replaces the spurious zeros appearing when masking of land only PEs
with the appropriate "missing values".
