<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION -->
<div>

 This module sets up the surface boundary conditions for MOM. 
 Also fill Ocean_sfc derived-type used to pass information to other 
 component models.  Also write diagnostics related to surface
 boundary forcing.  

 The surface temperature should be the surface insitu temperature,
 which is the same as the surface potential temperature.  When the 
 model prognostic temperature variable is conservative temperature, 
 then the surface potential temperature is carried in T_diag(index_diag_temp).
 The resulting heat flux is potential enthalpy, which is the correct 
 field to be forcing the T_prog(index_temp) field when the prognostic
 temperature field is the conservative temperature.   

 We assume the winds passed to the ocean are on the B-grid 
 velocity point.  Likewise, we pass the currents back to the coupler 
 on the B-grid point.  Code will need to be modified if using another
 assumption.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</dt>
<dd>
 Initialize the ocean surface type, which passes information between ocean 
 and other component models. 

 Note that ocean model sst passed to the atmosphere must be the surface
 potential temperature (which is equated to surface in situ temperature).
 If the ocean prognostic temperature variable is conservative temperature,
 then the sst is carried in T_diag(index_diag_temp).  If the prognostic 
 temperature is potential temperature, then the sst is carried in 
 T_prog(index_temp). 

 Note that we assume the winds passed to the ocean are on the B-grid 
 velocity point.  Likewise, we pass the currents back to the coupler 
 on the B-grid point.  Code will need to be modified if using another
 coupler assumption.  

  Ocean_sfc%t_surf  = time averaged sst (Kelvin) passed to atmosphere/ice model
  Ocean_sfc%s_surf  = time averaged sss (psu) passed to atmosphere/ice models
  Ocean_sfc%u_surf  = time averaged u-current (m/sec) passed to atmosphere/ice models
  Ocean_sfc%v_surf  = time averaged v-current (m/sec)  passed to atmosphere/ice models 
  Ocean_sfc%sea_lev = time averaged ocean free surface height (m) plus patm/(grav*rho0) 
  Ocean_sfc%frazil  = time accumulated frazil (J/m^2) passed to ice model.  time averaging 
                      not performed, since ice model needs the frazil accumulated over the 
                      ocean time steps.  Note that Ocean_sfc%frazil is accumulated, whereas 
                      T_diag%frazil (saved in diagnostic tracer restart file) is instantaneous.

 Accumulate the ocean_sfc derived type over the course of the 
 ocean component sub-cycling used when coupling to other models. 

 Note that ocean model sst passed to the atmosphere must be the surface
 potential temperature (which is equated to surface in situ temperature).
 If the ocean prognostic temperature variable is conservative temperature,
 then the sst is carried in T_diag(index_diag_temp).  If the prognostic 
 temperature is potential temperature, then the sst is carried in 
 T_prog(index_temp). 

 Note that this routine is called after eta_and_pbot_diagnose,

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</dt>
<dd>
 Compute average of ocean surface quantities.  This is for coupling, 
 where pass time averaged information from ocean to other component
 models. Note that Ocean_sfc%frazil is NOT time averaged.  Rather, it 
 is accumulated from T_diag(index_frazil)%field in subroutine sum_ocean_sfc.
 Doing so is necessary for heat conservation between ocean and sea 
 ice systems.  Since it is not time averaged, frazil is not part of 
 this averaging subroutine.  

 Note that ocean model SST passed to the atmosphere is the surface
 potential temperature (which is equal to surface in situ temperature).
 If the ocean prognostic temperature variable is conservative temperature,
 then the sst is carried in T_diag(index_diag_temp).  If the prognostic 
 temperature is potential temperature, then the sst is carried in 
 T_prog(index_temp). 

 Note that if one removes the averaging, then we take only the 
 latest values of the surface fields.  This approach has been 
 found useful to stabilize the "concurrent" coupling approach.  

 Note that this routine is called after eta_and_pbot_diagnose,

 Subroutine to compute the surface fluxes derived from a

 We use a convention whereby a positive 
 flux enters the ocean:  (+) down convention. 

 When restoring salinity, one may choose to convert this
 flux to an implied water flux, or keep it a salt flux.
 Converting to a water flux will alter the sea level, and
 so alter the concentration of other tracers.  
 The default is to keep it as a salt flux.

 TEOS-10 expression for latent heat of fusion at the sea surface (p=0dbar)

 The following is from the from the matlab routine due to 
 McDougall and Barker with respect to the full pressure dependent 
 formulation.

 Note that the computed latent heat of fusion from this function has 
 errors that range between -0.4 and 0.3 J kg^-1, when compared with the 
 latent heats of melting derived from the Gibbs functions of ice and of 
 seawater (using the SIA code of TEOS-10).  However, the underlying data to
 the Gibbs function contains uncertainities of 200 J kg^-1 (IOC et al., 2010).

<tt>use_waterflux</tt>

<dl>
  Set to true when wish to use real fresh water flux as opposed to virtual 
  salt fluxes. This is the recommended method. The alternative virtual 
  tracer flux method (use_waterflux=.false.) is not routinely used at

  Set to true when aiming to suppress the leap-frog computational mode
  by setting pme and river equal to a time averaged value over the 
  present and previous time step.  This method requires an extra
  field in the restart file.  This method is not needed when using
  the TWO_LEVEL time tendency.  It remains for those who wish to 
  use the leap-frog THREE_LEVEL time stepping scheme.  
  Note that it does not lead to simple checks of conservation across
  model components, since there is a time averaging performed for 
  the water flux added to the ocean model.  It is generally NOT 
  recommended.  Default waterflux_tavg=.false. 
  <br>
<span class="type">[logical]</span>
</dl>

  To add an idealized liquid runoff read from a file.
  This runoff is assumed to enter the ocean with the same temperature as
  SST, and to be liquid.  It is an additional runoff, so that any other

  When running a use_waterflux=.true. model, we may choose to add the

  a fresh water flux. The addition of salt does not alter the sea

  converting to an implied water flux will alter sea level and other
  concentrations.  So we generally recommend the default

  When computing the restoring flux for salinity, we can define
  a maximum absolute value for the difference between salinity(k=1)
  and the restoring salinity from a dataset.  This approach is useful
  especially in NAtl western boundary, where poor Gulf Stream separation
  can lead to large salinity biases.  If restore too much the salinity
  field, we can spuriously transport large amounts of fresh water to the 
  subpoloar gyre, thus impacting the overturning circulation too much.  
  If max_delta_salinity_restore &lt; 0.0, then will NOT provide a max to the 
  delta salinity; will instead compute an unbounded restoring flux.

  fresh water to the ocean associated with p-e+r. Do so by removing 
  area mean from pme--keep river values unchanged. Note that a choice
  must be made whether to remove the area mean from rivers or pme.  
  We choose pme since it is more evenly distributed than rivers.   
  Also note that we DO NOT include the ice melt in this normalization.
  The reason is that we only wish to ensure the ocean+ice system
  has a zero net water.  When melt or form sea ice, this only transfers
  water between liquid ocean and solid sea ice, and no normalization is
  appropriate for this case. It is only the water exchanged with the
  land and atmosphere that is normalized.

  This logical keeps the total water forcing on the ocean+ice system

  the ice melt in this normalization.  
  Setting zero_net_water_couple_restore to true may be appropriate when 
  running an ice-ocean model using a bulk formulae to compute
  evaporation (e.g., CORE) and when only providing a weak (or zero)
  salinity restoring.  It is not appropriate when running a coupled
  ocean-atmosphere model, where the moisture budget should be 
  conserved without an artificial removal of the global mean.

  For the case where land model passes through the coupler the heat flux 
  associated with the liquid runoff and calving land ice fields.
  This heat flux is computed relative to 0C, and takes the form 
  heat flux = mass flux of water * temp of water * heat capacity, 
  where the water can be either liquid or solid.  For many coupled models,
  the water temperature is assumed to be that of the SST.  But 
  more complete land models now carry the heat of its water relative to 0C,
  in which case the ocean model does not need to assume anything about the 
  heat content of the land water. 
  Default land_model_heat_fluxes=.false.

<tt>max_ice_thickness</tt>

<dl>
  When coupling MOM to an ice model, the sea ice thickness may need
  to be restricted to prevent vanishing top-level in MOM. Set 
  max_ice_thickness (meters) &lt; dzt(k=1) to restrict. This truncation 
  avoids the numerical problem but we loose mass conservation in the coupled
  sea ice and ocean system. We also alter the pressure felt on the ocean 
  as applied by the sea ice. Different vertical coordinates are needed 
  to do the problem more realistically.   

  Note that the problem of vanishing top layer is removed when use
  either ZSTAR or PSTAR as vertical coordinate.

  Set to true if wish to use the spread_river_horz algorithm to spread 
  the river runoff flux horizontally over an area into the ocean wider than

<tt>use_full_patm_for_sea_level</tt>
</dt>
<dl>
 The option use_full_patm_for_sea_level allows for the passing 
 of the sea level including the full weight of sea ice back to
 the ice model.  This approach maintains the max weight on the liquid
 ocean according to the nml variable max_ice_thickness.  But it does 
 allow the sea ice to know when there is actually more sea ice than that
 set by max_ice_thickness.  This option then provides for a negative
 feedback on the runaway growth of sea ice, since the full pressure acting to 
 make the ice flow will be correctly felt.  This is a new option, and is not
 fully tested, So the default is use_full_patm_for_sea_level=.false

  The default value is do_bitwise_exact_sum=.true. in order to ensure answers
  do not change when alter processors.  But if wish to enhance the efficiency
  of coupled ocean-ice models that use one of the global normalization options
  zero_net_salt_restore        =.true.
