<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
<!-- BEGIN OVERVIEW -->
<p class="text">
 Compute the hydrostatic pressure and forces from pressure. 
 Includes methods for either Bgrid or Cgrid. 
</p>
<!-- END OVERVIEW -->
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION -->
<div>
 This module computes hydrostatic pressure and the pressure force
 acting at a velocity point (traditional finite difference approach).
 This force is used for the linear momentum equation.  

 This module takes account of the vertical coordinate,
 which determines details of the calculation.  

 This module allows for either Bgrid or Cgrid calculation.

 Compute pressure (dbars) exerted at T cell grid point by weight of
 water column above the grid point. 

 rho = density in kg/m^3

 psurf = surface pressure in Pa= kg/(m*s^2) = hydrostatic pressure 
 at z=0 associated with fluid between z=0 and z=eta_t.
 Also include pressure from atmosphere and ice, both of which 
 are part of the patm array. 

 This routine is used by ocean_density to compute the pressure 
 used in the equation of state.  It is only called when the 
 vertical coordinate is DEPTH_BASED.

<h4>hydrostatic_pressure</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</dt>
<dd>
 Hydrostatic pressure [Pa=N/m^2=kg/(m*s^2)] at T cell grid points.

 For GEOPOTENTIAL vertical coordinate, integration is 
 from z=0 to depth of grid point.  This integration results in  
 the so-called "baroclinic" pressure. 

 For ZSTAR or ZSIGMA, vertical coordinate, integration is from z=eta to 
 depth of grid point.  This is allowed because ZSTAR and ZSIGMA 
 absorb the undulations of the surface height into their definition.

 If the input density "rho" is an anomoly, the resulting presure 
 will be a hydrostatic pressure anomoly. If "rho" is full density, 
 the presure will be a full hydrostatic pressure.

 Geopotential anomaly [m^2/s^2] at T cell grid points.
 Integration here is from z=-H to depth of grid point.

 This function is needed when computing pressure gradient
 for PRESSURE_BASED vertical coordinates. 

 WARNING: Thickness%method==FINITEVOLUME has been found to be 
 problematic.  It remains under development.  It is NOT
