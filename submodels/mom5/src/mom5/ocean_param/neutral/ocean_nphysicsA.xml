 Thickness weighted and density weighted time tendency for tracer 
 from Laplacian neutral diffusion + Laplacian GM skew-diffusion.
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 This module computes the cell thickness weighted and density 
 weighted tracer tendency from small angle Laplacian neutral diffusion
 plus Laplacian GM skew-diffusion.  The algorithms are based on 
 MOM4p0d methods.  The fundamental differences from the ocean_nphysicsB
 methods relate to the handling of fluxes near the domain boundaries.

 Numerical implementation of the flux components follows the triad 
 approach documented in the references and implemented in MOM2 and MOM3.  
 The MOM algorithm accounts for partial bottom cells and generalized

 neutral_physics_simple=.true. requires aredi_equal_agm=.true.
 neutral_physics_simple=.true. results in down-gradient  
 horizontal flux components. This setting reduces the overall cost 
 of the neutral physics scheme, but it is not used at GFDL
 anymore, since we favor methods whereby treatment of GM and Redi
 in the boundary layers are distinct.  
 </NOTE><NOTE> 
 In steep slope regions, neutral diffusive fluxes are tapered to
 zero with the tanh taper of Danabasoglu and McWilliams (1995) or the 
 quadratic scheme of Gerdes, Koberle, and Willebrand.  However, if
 neutral_physics_simple=.false., the GM skew-diffusive fluxes 
 can remain nonzero if have neutral_linear_gm_taper=.true.

 This function computes the thickness weighted and density weighted
 time tendency for tracer from neutral physics.  Full discussion
 and details are provided by Griffies (2004). 

 Here is a brief summary.  

---How the neutral diffusive flux components are computed:

 The vertical flux component is split into diagonal (3,3) and 
 off-diagonal (3,1) and (3,2) terms. The off-diagonal (3,1) and (3,2) 
 terms are included explicitly in time. The main contribution from the 
 (3,3) term to the time tendency is included implicitly in time 
 along with the usual contribution from diapycnal processes 
 (vertical mixing schemes).  This is the K33_implicit term.
 This approach is necessary with high vertical resolution, as 
 noted by Cox (1987).  However, splitting the vertical flux into 
 an implicit and explicit piece compromises the 
 integrity of the vertical flux component (see Griffies et al. 1998).
 So to minimize the disparity engendered by this split, the portion of 
 K33 that can be stably included explicitly in time is computed along 
 with the (3,1) and (3,2) terms. 
 
 All other terms in the mixing tensor are included explicitly in time
 using a forward time step as required for temporal stability of 
 numerical diffusive processes.  

 The off-diagonal terms in the horizontal flux components, and all terms
 in the vertical flux component, are tapered in regions of steep neutral
 slope according to the requirements of linear stability.  MOM allows for 
 choice of two tapering schemes:

 (a) the tanh taper of Danabasoglu and McWilliams (1995)
 (b) the quadratic scheme of Gerdes, Koberle, and Willebrand (1991)

 Linear stability is far less stringent on the diagonal (1,1) and (2,2)
 part of the horizontal flux.  Indeed, these terms in practice need
 not be tapered in steep sloped regions. The namelist 
 neutral_taper_diagonal=.false. keeps the diagnonal terms maintained 
 for all neutral slopes. This approach assists in reducing numerical
 noise in regions where the physical system experiences a lot of
 diapycnal mixing anyhow. 

---How the skew diffusive flux components are computed:

 The GM skew flux components are purely off-diagonal.  
 They are generally tapered when neutral slope 
 is large (neutral_physics_simple=.false).
 Doing so maintains a nontrivial GM slumping effect even when the 
 neutral slopes are vertical.  The alternative neutral_physics_simple=.true.
 is the approach used in MOM3, whereby GM effects are removed 
 in steep sloped regions.  neutral_physics_simple=.false. is 
 less efficient, but has been seen to yield superior simulations.

 Subroutine computes the boundary layer as determined by 
 1. steep neutral slopes
 2. depth within which typical mesoscale eddies are partially outcropped
 3. depth within which vertical mixing scheme (e.g., kpp) computes a boundary layer

 Note: Only consider surface boundary layers here.

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="fz_terms" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Subroutine computes the tracer independent pieces of the vertical 
 flux component. As a result of this routine, 
 Array tensor_31 = x-diffusivity*slope (m^2/sec) for fz
 Array tensor_32 = y-diffusivity*slope (m^2/sec) for fz 

 K33 is the (3,3) term in small angle Redi diffusion tensor.
 It is broken into an explicit in time piece and implicit 
 in time piece.  It is weighted by density for non-Boussinesq
 and rho0 for Boussinesq.  

 K33 has units (kg/m^3)*m^2/sec.

 Also will compute the squared Eady growth rate, with the maximum
 slope contributing to this growth rate set by smax.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="fz_terms_diag" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 For saving the contributions from GM and Redi separately, it is 
 necessary to compute the tensor_redi component here. 

 We do so here, reproducing some lines of code from fz_terms,
 to reduce minimize the need to impinge on the case when NOT
 using this generally expensive (memory and computational)
 diagnostic.  

 This routine MUST be called prior to fz_terms, since we use
 tensor_31 and tensor_32 in their raw slope forms here.
