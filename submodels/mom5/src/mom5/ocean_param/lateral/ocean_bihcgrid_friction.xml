 This module computes the thickness weighted time tendency for  
 horizontal velocity arising from horizontal biharmonic friction. 
 Friction is formulated for the C-grid here. 
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 This module computes the thickness weighted time tendency for
 horizontal velocity arising from horizontal biharmonic friction. 
 The viscosity used to determine the strength of the tendency 
 can be a general function of space and time as specified by 
 the Smagorinsky approach; a grid-scale dependent
 background viscosity; or other options.  
 The form of the friction operator can be isotropic or 
 anisotropic in the horizontal plane. 

 Friction is formulated for the C-grid in this module.

 Initialize the lateral biharmonic friction module by 
 registering fields for diagnostic output and performing some 
 numerical checks to see that viscosity is set appropriately.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="bihcgrid_friction" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 This routine computes thickness weighted and density weighted 
 time tendency for horizontal velocity arising from horizontal 
 biharmonic friction.  

 The algorithm is derived from a functional approach that ensures
 kinetic energy is consistenty dissipated for all flow configurations. 
 The stencil is far simpler than the B-grid approach. In particular, 
 there are no triads here for the C-grid.  
 
 Fundamental to the scheme are the rates of horizontal deformation 
 horizontal tension = DT = (dy)(u/dy)_x - (dx)(v/dx)_y             
 horizontal strain  = DS = (dx)(u/dx)_y + (dy)(v/dy)_x             
 Units of the tension and strain are sec^-1.

 As shown in Griffies and Hallberg (2000), 
 a biharmonic operator with a nonconstant viscosity is guaranteed to 
 dissipate kinetic energy *only* when using the sqrt of the biharmonic
 viscosity at each of the two stages of the algorithm. 
 The sqrt approach is employed here.  

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="ncar_boundary_scale_read" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>

 Read in the 3d ncar boundary scaling field and use this to 
 rescale the background viscosities. 
 
 To use this routine, we need to already have generated the field
 ncar_rescale using the routine ncar_boundary_scale_create.

 The advantage of reading ncar_rescale is that we do not need to 
 introduce any global 2d arrays required for ncar_boundary_scale_create.     
 So the idea is to pay the price once by running ncar_boundary_scale_create,
 save ncar_rescale, then read that field in during subsequent runs through 
 ncar_boundary_scale_read.

 Here are the steps:
 1/ run one time with ncar_boundary_scaling_read=.false.
 and ncar_boundary_scaling=.true. 
 Be sure that the field ncar_rescale is saved in diagnostic table.
 To ensure answers agree whether reading ncar_rescale or creating it
 during initialization, it is necessary to save ncar_rescale using the
 double precision option in the diagnostic table (packing=1). 

 2/ extract field ncar_rescale from the diagnostics output
 and place into its own file INPUT/ncar_rescale.nc
 example extraction using ncks:
 ncks -v ncar_rescale 19900101.ocean_month.nc ncar_rescale.nc

 3/ set ncar_boundary_scaling_read=.true. 
 and ncar_boundary_scaling=.true., and now run the model 
 reading in ncar_rescale rather than regenerating
 it during each initialization (which can be a bottleneck 
 for large models on huge processor counts).   

 4/ As a check that all is fine, save ncar_rescale as a diagnostic
 for both the create and the read stage and make sure they agree.  
 Also, all checksums should agree whether reading in ncar_rescale
 or creating it each initialization, so long as the ncar_rescale.nc
 was saved with double precision  (see step 1/ above).

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="ncar_boundary_scale_create" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>

     Recale the background viscosities to be larger in the western 
     boundary regions.  The algorithm is taken directly from the 
     anisotropic_ncar routine in ocean_lapgen_friction.F90.

   NOTE: The nearest western boundary computations are done along the
         model i-grid lines. Therefore, viscosity based on these are 
         only approximate in the high Northern Hemisphere when using 
         generalized coordinates with coordinate pole(s) shifted onto 
         land.

 Method follows that of 
 Maltrud and Holloway, 2008: Implementing biharmonic neptune in a 
 global eddying ocean model, Ocean Modelling, vol. 21, pages 22-34. 

 This approach is slightly different than the Eby and Holloway
 method implemented in the laplacian module. There is no fundamental
 reason to favor one versus the other.  We use the Maltrud and 
 Holloway method here sinc they implemented it for biharmonic.
