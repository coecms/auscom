 Thickness weighted and density weighted time tendency 
 for tracer from lateral laplacian diffusion.  
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 This module computes lateral laplacian diffusion of a tracer.
 There are two main options.

 (1) The lateral tracer fluxes can be aligned with the z-coordinate surfaces,
 in which case the fluxes must be approximated if (i) we use non-geopotential
 vertical coordinates, (ii) next to partial bottom step topography.
 This form of the diffusion is not recommended since it can lead to 
 the creation of spurious extrema.  

 (2) The lateral tracer fluxes can be aligned surfaces of constant vertical 
 coordinate. In this case the fluxes are no longer strictly "horizontal."
 However, the operator is simpler and it ensures that no suprious
 extrema are created. It is for this reason that the simpler operator
 is preferred.   
  
 The diffusivity used to determine the strength of the tendency can be 
 a general function of space yet it is constant in time.  A namelist 
 option exists that determines this diffusivity as a local function 
 of the grid spacing.

 The numerical implementation requires no calls to mpp_update_domains.

  To compute diffusion along surfaces of constant depth.
  This operation must necessarily be approximate for the two 
  cases (i) non-geopotential vertical coordinates, (2)
  next to partial bottom step topography.  There are cases where
  use of this operator can lead to spurious creation of extrema
  due to truncation errors associated with the "slope" term.
  For most cases where lateral diffusion is required, we 
  will want it to be "diffusive" in the sense that no extrema are
  created.  So the default is horz_z_diffuse=.false.
  The option to use horz_z_diffuse=.true. is maintained for 
  legacy purposes alone.  
  </DATA><DATA NAME="horz_s_diffuse" TYPE="logical">

  This operation is ensured of obtaining a smoothing operator
  that does not create extrema. It is the default for this

  If .true., then the diffusivity is set according to a velocity scale times
