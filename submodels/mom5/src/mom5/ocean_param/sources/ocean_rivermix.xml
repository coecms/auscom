 Tracer source from discharging river with depth or 
 mixing rivers with depth. 
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 Compute thickness weighted tendency [tracer*rho*meter/sec]
 associated with discharge of river tracer content 
 over a user defined column of ocean points. Points are
 selected based on whether river flow into a point is nonzero.
 Contribution added to tracer source array.

 Algorithm ensures total tracer is conserved.  Note that volume/mass is 
 modified by river water within the eta-equation using the big leap-frog.  
 </NOTE></INFO><NAMELIST NAME="ocean_rivermix_nml"><DATA NAME="use_this_module" TYPE="logical">
  Must be true to enable this module.  Default=.true., since
  this is the only way that tracer in river water enters the ocean. 
  </DATA><DATA NAME="discharge_combine_runoff_calve" TYPE="logical">
  Set discharge_combine_runoff_calve=.true. to discharge combined tracer carried
  by liquid and solid runoff. This approach is sensible when ocean 
  assigns a tracer content to the liquid and solid runoff fields.  
  The alternative is to have a land model that provides information about
  the tracer coming into the ocean from land water, in which case it is 
  preferable to set discharge_combine_runoff_calve=.false., so to do the runoff 
  and calving separately.  
  Default discharge_combine_runoff_calve=.true.

 Initial set up for mixing of tracers at runoff points. 
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="rivermix" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 This subroutine computes one or all of the following: 

 (1) Thickness weighted and rho weighted tracer source associated 
 with river tracer content discharged into a vertical column of ocean 
 tracer cells. This is done if river_discharge=.true.

 (2) Enhance vertical diffusivity at river mouths. 
 This is done if river_diffuse_temp=.true. or 
 river_diffuse_salt=.true. 

 Doing one or both are useful for models with fine vertical  
 resolution, where discharging river content to top cell 
 is often not numerically suitable nor physically relevant.

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="river_discharge_tracer" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Compute thickness weighted tracer source [tracer*m/s]
 associated with the discharge of tracer from a river over 
 a vertical column whose thickness is set by River_insertion_thickness 
 and whose horizontal location is given by the river array. 

 Jan 2005: converted to mass weighting for use with non-Boussinesq
 pressure-like coodinates. 

 This subroutine is maintained for legacy purposes.

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="runoff_calving_discharge_tracer" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Compute thickness weighted tracer source [tracer*m/s]
 associated with the discharge of tracer from runoff or calving over 
 a vertical column whose thickness is set by either runoff_insertion_thickness 
 or calving_insertion_thickness, and whose horizontal location is given 
 by the runoff or calving array. 

 Jan 2005: converted to mass weighting for use with non-Boussinesq
 pressure-like coodinates. 

 Feb 2009: now use calving_tracer_flux and runoff_tracer_flux, as the 
 land model carries information about the tracer content in the 
 liquid and solid runoff.  

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="river_kappa" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 This subroutine enhances the vertical diffusivity kappa over 
 a vertical column whose thickness is set by river_diffusion_thickness 
 and whose horizontal location is given by the rmask array.
 Note that rmask can be &gt; 0 even if river=0 in the case when 
 use virtual salt flux.   
 The enhanced diffusivity is maximum at the top cell and is linearly 
 interpolated to the normal diffusivity at the depth set by 
 river_diffusion_thickness
