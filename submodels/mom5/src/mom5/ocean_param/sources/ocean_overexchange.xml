 Exchange of tracer properties as dense shallow parcel discharged
 into deeper water to approach the depth of neutral buoyancy.  
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 Exchange of tracer properties as dense shallow parcel is discharged
 into deeper water to approach the parcel's depth of neutral buoyancy.
 This module can be characterized as a mixture of the approach from
 Campin and Goosse (1999) and and dynamically determined xlandmix.

  </DATA><DATA NAME="do_bitwise_exact_sum" TYPE="logical">
  Set true to do bitwise exact global sum. When it is false, the global
  sum will be non-bitwise_exact, but will significantly increase efficiency. 
  The default value is false.
  </DATA><DATA NAME="overexch_npts" TYPE="integer">
  Number of points used in search for the exchange method. 
  Default overexch_npts=1.  Note: it is not possible to have 
  overexch_npts greater than or equal to the computational domain
  extents, as this would require updates across multiple processors. 
  Default overexch_npts=1.

  To place more weight on points further from central point.  This may 
  be done to enhance properties getting downslope.  Default is 
  overexch_weight_far=.false.

  Width of the re-weighting function used to emphasize the points further

  Stability factor for determining the maximum overexch_flux.

  Check to be sure there are no global tracer extrema formed due

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="overexchange" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Compute thickness and density weighted tracer source [tracer*rho*m/s]
 due to exchange of tracer properties in regions where density-driven
 overflows are favorable. Allow for exchanges to occur over horizontally 
 distant points, so long as the dense shallow parcel finds that it 
 will sit on the bottom of the horizontally adjacent columns.  Doing
 so requires a search algorithm, which requires some if-test logic
 as well as extended halos.  Note that the halos cannot be extended
 to larger than the size of the computational domain on a processor.
 This restriction limits the extent that we can search horizontally.

 This scheme can be characterized as a dynamical xlandmix based on 
 the scheme of Campin and Goosse.  The rates for the exchange are 
 functions of the topographic slope and the density differences
 between parcels.
