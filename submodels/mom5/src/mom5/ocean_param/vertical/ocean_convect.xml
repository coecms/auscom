 Vertically adjusts gravitationally unstable columns of ocean fluid.
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 This module vertically adjusts gravitationally unstable columns of 
 ocean fluid.  

 Three algorithms are available:

 1. Full convection from Rahmstorf.  The algorithm produces a fully 
 stable fluid column.  Since most convection propagates downward, the
 scheme looks downward first and follows any instability (upward or
 downward) before checking the other direction. The routine mixes 
 passive tracers only after the entire instability is found. 

 2. Full convection from Rahmstorf as optimized for vector machines
 by Russ Fiedler. 

 3. The Cox (1984) NCON-scheme.  This scheme is recommended only 
 for those wishing to maintain legacy code. 

 4. Legacy (pre TEOS-10) versions now supplied. In TEOS-10 we 
 need to mix S_prog, fdelta first, and then compute S_A. This 
 approach is not the same as mixing S_A directly.

 </REFERENCE><NOTE>
 Implementation of the full convection scheme is 
 based on mom2/3 code by Stefan Rahmstorf 
 (rahmstorf@pik-potsdam.de). But  modified slightly 
 for efficiency purposes in mom3.1
 by M. Eby (eby@uvic.ca) in June 2000. Notably, Eby 
 eliminated goto statements.     
 </NOTE><NOTE>
 The Eby code was ported to mom4 by Griffies (Stephen.Griffies). 
 </NOTE><NOTE>
 To recover the exact same numerical values as the original
 Rahmstorf code, look for the two "Rahmstorf" comments in the code.

 Initialize the convection module.
 
 For the full convection module, we register two fields
 for diagnostic output.  
 <BR/>
 ktot  = number of levels convected  in a vertical column
 <BR/> 
 kven  = number of levels ventilated in a vertical column

 Note that ktot can in rare cases count some levels twice, if they
 get involved in two originally separate, but then
 overlapping convection areas in the water column. The field 
 kven is 0 on land, 1 on ocean points with no
 convection, and any value up to nk on convecting points.
