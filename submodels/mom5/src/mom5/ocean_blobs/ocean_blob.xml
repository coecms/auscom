</CONTACT><OVERVIEW>
 This is the main "driver" module for the Lagrangian blob scheme.  This 
 module calls other modules that contain the individual parameterisations.

 Please note that the preprocessor option MOM_STATIC_ARRAYS is NOT
 supported.  This is because to run a model where the memeory statically
 allocated without the blob framework will incur a large, unnecessary
 increase in memory requirements.
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 This module is the top-level module of the Lagrangian blob framework.
 It calls routines to form blobs, to integrate their properties, to
 transfer them from one dynamic regime to another, and also calculates
 the L system contribution towards grid cell thickness.

 This module also handles some framework wide variables, mostly
 associated with system wide diagnostics and the system wide accounting 
 required to ensure the Eulerian model and the Lagrangian model can coexist.

 It should be noted that many of the parameterisations are not mutually 
 exclusive.  As such, care should be excercised when creating namelists 
 for experiments.

  Must be true to use this module. 
  Default is use_this_module=.false. 
  </DATA><DATA NAME="debug_this_module" TYPE="logical">
  Writes additional diagnostic data to fms.out.  This 
  also controls debug output for the other related blob
  modules.
  Default is debug_this_module=.false. 
  </DATA><DATA NAME="really_debug" TYPE="logical">
  Be careful what you wish for, this outputs A LOT of
  diagnostics to standard out!
  Default is debug_this_module=.false. 
  </DATA><DATA NAME="do_bitwise_exact_sum" TYPE="logical">
  When global sum outputs are done there is additional
  computational expense to ensure that they are bitwise
  the same across an arbitrary number of processors.  
  However, for debugging purposes, it can be useful
  for global sums to be the same.  Note, that this differs
  from bitwise_reproduction in that it do_bitwise_exact_sum
  only applies to the mpp_global_sum diagnostic.
  Note that this flag controls the output for all associated
  blob modules.
  Default is do_bitwise_exact_sum=.false. 
  </DATA><DATA NAME="bitwise_reproduction" TYPE="logical">
  There is additional cost involved in ensuring that
  results are reproducable across an arbitrary number of
  processors and across restarts.  
  Bitwise reproduction is a very memory intensive operation and should 
  only be used for debugging.  For bitwise_reproduction=.true. We need 
  to process blobs and their histories in the same relative order 
  regardless of domain decomposition and restarts. To do so, we save the 
  "history" of each blob subcycle is saved to a number of arrays (which 
  can be a very memory intensive process) and process them in order.
  Note that this flag controls reproducability for all associated
  blob modules.
  Bitwise reproducibility is only possible with the appropriate
  compiler flags AND when the simulation is run on hardware that is
  capable of producing bitwise reproduction.
  Default is bitwise_reproduction=.false. 
  </DATA><DATA NAME="blob_small_mass" UNITS="kg" TYPE="real">
  Will delete blobs of mass less than blob_small_mass.
  Note that this variable is for all associated blob 
  modules.  The deletion of blobs is a conservative
  action, any mass/tracer fields that are nonzero
  have the remaining properties transferred back to the
  Eulerian system.  So, in principle, blob_small_mass
  can actually be a relatively large number, and the 
  model will remain conservative.  It has been found in 
  certain test cases (with very low tracer values) that
  setting blob_small_mass to be very small (i.e. &lt;1e2)
  that roundoff error can cause non-trivial errors.  So,
  it is recommended that blob_small_mass be no smaller than
  than 1e3 kg (which is approximately 1.0m**3 -- a very small
  blob!)
  Default is blob_small_mass=1.e3
  </DATA><DATA NAME="mass_prop_thickness" UNITS="dimensionless" TYPE="real">
  Sets the maximum proportion of a grid cell that the

 Initialises the Lagrangian blob module by setting up module wide
 variables and calling initialisation scripts for the related modules,
 as well as the Lagrangian system itself.

 Infrastructure for communicating between PE's, interpolation of E
 system variables to a blob, communicating model wide namelist values
 and variables to other modules and picking up restarts is all done.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="init_blob_thickness" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Initialises the L_system thickness, based on the existing blobs
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="ocean_blob_update" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Updates the Lagrangian blobs by calling routines that run during the
 explicit in time part of the time step.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="ocean_blob_cell_update" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 
 For bottom blobs, it diagnoses the blobs vertical position in the 
 models native vertical coordinate.

 For free blobs, it searches for the vertical grid cell that a free 
 blob resides in.

 We require the information regarding the vertical grid cell that a 
 blob resides in prior to the calculation of total grid cell thickness
 and prior to the calculation of the vertical advection velocity.

 In order to figure out which grid cell the blob is in, we need to
 employ different strategies for different coordinate system (see notes
 for details).

 For any blobs that penetrate the free surface (which is unlikely, but
 not impossible) we immediately kill them, returning their properties
 to the surface grid cell of the (i,j) column that they belong to.

 We recalculate a blobs density and volume for taup1, based on the pressure 
 at the centre of the grid cell that it resides in.

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="update_L_thickness" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Calculates the contribution to thickness of all the blobs for the
 L system arrays in the Thickness strcture.

 The mass per unit area from the blobs is also calculated for the 
 upper and lower part of each grid cell and stored in the L_system 
 structure.  The calculate of mass per unit area is required for
 pressure calculations.

 We note that in DEPTH_BASED models, the value for density used is
 rho0, while it is the actual density in PRESSURE_BASED models. For
 the L_system mass per unit area, the actual density is used for
 all supported coordinates.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="calculate_rhoT" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Calculates the density of the combined E and L systems.

 It needs to be done here so that the blobs are taken into account.

 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="ocean_blob_implicit" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Updates the Lagrangian blobs by calling routines that run during the
 implicit in time part of the time step.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="adjust_L_thickness" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 blob_thickness is called after new blobs are formed implicitly in 
 time.  blob_thickness provides the same function as 
 update_L_thickness, with a couple of subtle differences.

 At the point that this routine is called, we:
 1/ Know the vertical position of an "old" blob relative to the geoid
    and in the Eulerian model's native vertical coordinate.  We do 
    not know a blobs depth relative to the sea surface.
 2/ Know the vertical position relative to the sea surface for "new"
    blobs, but we do not know its position relative to the geoid or in
    the Euerlian model's native vertical coordinate.

 So, blob_thickness uses the logical new, which is part of the blob
 derived type, to distinguish between new blobs and old blobs. New
 blobs have their position (upper or lower part of a grid cell) 
 calculated using the depth relative to the sea surface height, while
 blobs that are not new have their position calculated using the 
 Eulerian models native coordinate.
 
 The accumulation of thickness and mass per unit area are done in the
 same was as is done in update_L_thickness.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="ocean_blob_diagnose_depth" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 When blobs are created implicitly in time, the sea surface height has
 not been calcualted in pressure based models (but depth has).  However, 
 the prognostic variable for blobs is the geodepth and not the depth.  So,
 for a new blob, we set the depth when it is formed and then calculate
 the geodepth here.  For existing blobs, we diagnose the depth using
 eta_t and geodepth.

 We note that in GEOPOTENTIAL coordinates, depth and geodepth are 
 equivalent, and so we set them to be equivalent for the blobs too.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="ocean_blob_end" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Writes restarts and do checksums for the blobs at the end of a run.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="write_all_blobs" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 A convenient subroutine for debugging that dumps blob details from 
 every list
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="entrainment_checksum" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Do the entrainment checksums
