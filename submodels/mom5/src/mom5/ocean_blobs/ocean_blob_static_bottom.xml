</CONTACT><OVERVIEW>
 Contains static bottom blob parameterisations, namely the Campin and 
 Goossee (1999) scheme and some variations.
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 Presently, there is only one static bottom blob scheme implemented 
 (although, there are three potential variants), and there are no plans
 to implement any additional schemes.

 The scheme that is implemented emulates the Campin and Goossee (1999) 
 scheme, as well as having two additional variations for this scheme, 
 in which the "plumbing" is change.

 Details of the variations can be found in Bates et al. (2010) and are 
 controlled by the namelist options overflow_no_return and
 overflow_one_return.

 Initialises the static bottom blob module.
 </DESCRIPTION></SUBROUTINE><SUBROUTINE NAME="blob_overflow_like" INTERFACE=""><DESCRIPTION>
 Run the Lagrangian blob model for the Overflow schemes.  These 
 schemes are static schemes and uses Lagrangian blobs to transport 
 tracer and mass down slopes where an onshelf/offshelf instability
 exists.

 This scheme is activated by setting the namelist variable 
 blob_overflow=.true.

 There are three flavours to this scheme, which are detailed in
 sections 2.4 and 2.5 of Bates et al. for further details.  The three
 flavours are:
 1/ A Campin and Goosse (1999) scheme in which the full "plumbing" of
    water going off shelf to the deep ocean and deep ocean waters
    returning on shelf is specified (described in full in section 2.4
    of Bates et al.)
 2/ Only the lateral part of the plumbing is specified and all vertical
    movement of water within the deep ocean column is taken care of 
    (described in full in section 2.5 of Bates et al.).  This option is
    activated by setting the namelist variable overflow_one_return=.true.
 3/ Only the movement of shelf water to the deep ocean column is
    explicitly dealt with (described in full in section 2.5 of Bates
    et al.).  This option is activated by setting the namelist variable
    overflow_no_return=.true.
 
 Other namelist variables associated with this scheme are:
  blob_overflow_mu (real), which is the coefficient of friction used
    used to calculate the overflow velocity,
  blob_overflow_delta (real), which is the fraction of a grid cell that
    participates in any one overflow event,
  blob_overflow_umax (real), which is the maximum overflow velocity.
    Depending on the flavour of scheme chosen and the impact that you want
    it to have, typical values should be O(0.01) to O(1).
