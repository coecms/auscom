   This program works together with program make_xgrids, create_grid to 
   remap runoff data from a spherical grid onto any grid (spherical or tripolar) 
   using conservative scheme.
 </OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 This program expects to read runoff data from a netcdf file, which is specfied
 by the namelist variable "src_data". The name of the runoff field in input file is specified 
 by the namelist variable "src_fld_name". The output file is a netcdf file specified
 by the namelist variable "dst_data". The name of the runoff field in output file is specified 
 by the namelist variable "src_fld_name". Both the source grid and  destination grid 
 are read from netcdf file "grid_spec.nc". The grid_spec.nc is expected contains
 field 'x_T' and 'y_T', which is the new name convention used as a prototype for ESMF.
 The source grid read from variable "xta" and "yta" of "grid_spec.nc" should match 
 the grid in "src_data". "grid_spec.nc" is generated by 
 " make_xgrid -a atmos_grid.nc -l atmos_grid.nc -o dst_grid.nc ",
 where dst_grid is the grid which you want remap runoff data on and atmos_grid.nc 
 is generated through program "create_grid", which is located at the same directory
 as this program. make_xgrid is a c program that generates exchange grid between 
 atmos, ocean and land grid. make_xgrid source code is located at 
 "../generate_grids/make_xgrids". If there is any land point has runoff data 
 after remapping runoff data onto destination grid, the runoff value of that land point
 will be moved to the nearest ocean point.
