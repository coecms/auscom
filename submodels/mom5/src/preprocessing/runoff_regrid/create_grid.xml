<PROGRAM NAME="create_grid" DATE="0000/00/00 00:00:00" HISTORY="http://cobweb.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms-cgi-bin/viewcvs/preprocessing/runoff_regrid"><CONTACT EMAIL="GFDL.Climate.Model.Info@noaa.gov"> Zhi Liang </CONTACT><OVERVIEW>
   This program works together with program make_xgrids, runoff_regrid to 
   remap runoff data from a spherical grid onto any grid. This program can 
   generate a spherical grid netcdf file that can be used to generate exchange 
   grid grid_spec.nc with the destination grid file ( ocean grid file). 
   
 </OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 This program expects to get grid data from a netcdf file, which is specfied
 by the namelist variable "src_data". The name of the runoff field is specified 
 by the namelist variable "src_fld_name". The output file is a netcdf file with
 name "atmos_grid.nc".
