  Generate a grid specification data file for ocean.
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
  This program can generate horizontal grid, vertical grid or grids with topography and land/sea mask. .
  The namelist option grid_type control the type of grid created. when grid_type equal
  <PRE> 1. "hgrid": only horizontal grid will be created.
 2. "vgrid": only vertical grid will be created
 4. "hgrid_topog" : horizontal grid, topography and land/sea mask will be created. 
    Topography is obtained by remapping onto current grid from some topography source data. 
    land/sea mask is determined by the topography. In this case, topography does not depend 
    on vertical grid and no vertical grid will be created. You need to set topog_depend_on_vgrid of 
    topog_nml to .false. .
 5. "hgrid_vgrid_topog": horizontal grid, vertical grid, topography and land/sea mask 
    will be created. The topography is mom4-specific topography (could be idealized or from 
    some source file), which depends on vertical grid. The land/sea mask is determined by 
    topography. In this case, you need to set topog_depend_on_vgrid of topog_nml to .true. .</PRE>
