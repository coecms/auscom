 compare depth and land/sea mask of two grid_spec file. 
</OVERVIEW><DESCRIPTION>
 This program reads in two grid descriptor files (generated via ocean_grid_generator) 
 and creates a text file output listing line-by-line differences between the
 two files. Output file format is the same as the grid_edits file used by
 edit_grid.F90. These two files should have same grid size. 

 Originally developed by Jeffery B. Greenblatt on 12/11/2001 at Princeton University

  the land/sea mask at point (i,j) of grid_file_2 and wet_old 
  is the land/sea mask at point (i,j) of grid_file_1.
