#  This runscritp can be used to convert the old name convention grid specification
#  netcdf file to new name convention grid netcdf file. The user need to provide the
#  input grid file $old_grid and the program will generate the output grid file
#  $new_grid. The output file $new_grid contains both the new name convention grid
#  infofmation and all the fields in $old_grid.
#
#=======================================================================
#  This preprocessing program was tested with Intel Fortran compiler on ia64 at GFDL.
#  In order to run on other system, some changes may be needed.
