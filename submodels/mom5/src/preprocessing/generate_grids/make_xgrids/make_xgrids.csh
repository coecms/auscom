#      preprocessing : make_xgrids.csh
#         Contact : Zhi Liang   email : Zhi.Liang
#
#  This runscritp can be used to generate exchange grids between ocean, atmosphere and land grid.
#  The user need to create atmos_grid.nc, land_grid.nc and ocean_grid.nc before using make_xgrids.
#  Normally land_grid.nc is the same as atmos_grid.nc. 
#=======================================================================
#  This preprocessing program was tested with Intel Fortran compiler on ia64 at GFDL.
#  In order to run on other system, some changes may be needed.
#######################################################################
# Users need to modify the following variables according to their need. 
# These particular values are here for testing purposes in GFDL only.
