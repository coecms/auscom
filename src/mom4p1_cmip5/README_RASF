src now contains the mom4p1_pubrel_i18dec2009 release plus enhancements.

Note that the source contains some BLUELINK developments (OFAM). The default namelists
will not activate any OFAM components.

OFAM has its own special namelists and does not interfere with the normal running of MOM4.

The only components of MOM4P1 required for AusCOM and OFAM are in directories

mom4p1
