        <p>The Modular Ocean Model (MOM) is a numerical
        representation of the ocean's hydrostatic primitive
        equations. It is designed primarily as a tool for studying
        the global ocean climate system, as well as capabilities
        for regional and coastal applications. MOM4 is the latest
        version of the GFDL ocean model whose origins date back to
        the pioneering work of Kirk Bryan and Mike Cox in the
        1960s-1980s. It is developed and supported by researchers
        at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (<a href=
        "http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov" target="_top">GFDL</a>), with
        critical contributions also provided by researchers
        worldwide. The purpose of this web guide is to provide
        general information about MOM4, and particular information
        for how to download and run the code. <a href=
        "./MOM_history.pdf" target="_top">Here is a table</a>

            <li>MOM4p1: Dec 2009</li>
          </ul>
        </div>For each release, we aim to update MOM4 by enhancing
        features and documentation, and correcting bugs. Each
        version is generally compatible with the previous versions.
        However, as updates are made, we cannot guarantee that all
        features will bitwise agree across releases. Nonetheless,
        we do maintain a small selection of ``bitwise-legacy'' code
        to allow for certain modules to bitwise agreement across
        versions. As the maintenance of bitwise-legacy features
        represents an onerous task (e.g., bits change when A+B is
        altered to B+A), we recommend that researchers beginning
        new projects start with the most recent version, and that
        researchers with mature projects carefully test the new
        code prior to moving forward. Note that each of the MOM4
        releases is documented on this web page.

        <p>Since its release in January 2004, there have been
        hundreds of registrations with the MOM4 distribution, with
        each registration generally representing more than one
        user. This is a sizable user community. This community has
        proven to be a great resource, especially for users new to
        MOM4, and those with portability questions, some of which
        are beyond the abilities of GFDL scientists to answer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a name=
              "Efficiency and Portability"></a>1.6.&nbsp;Efficiency
              and Portability</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The MOM4 team aims to provide code that is efficient,
        flexible, and transparent for use across a broad range of
        computer platforms. Balancing these aims is not always
        simple. For example, some of the most efficient code is
        also the least transparent. The MOM4 developers are
        scientists whose main concern is to support MOM4 as a tool
        for science research. This focus then leads us to weight
        transparency and portability over efficiency. However, we
        readily make efficiency modifications that are of a general
        nature, so please do feel free to volunteer any such
        changes.</p>

        <p>Given the above aims, we have continued to support one
        avenue for code efficiency involving the allocation of
        arrays. MOM4 can be compiled in two ways: with static
        allocation of arrays or dynamic allocation. Static
        allocation is enabled at compile time via the
        cpp-preprocessor option MOM4_STATIC_ARRAYS. At GFDL, we
        have generally found that static allocation executables are
        faster than dynamic, since compilers like to know
        before-hand the size of the model arrays. Work on the SGI
        machines at GFDL has reduced the difference in efficiency
        between these two compilations. However, details of the
        model configuration strongly impact the differences in
        model speed. Additionally, we understand that on some
        platforms, the dynamic allocation results in faster code
        than static. Consequently, we have decided to maintain both
        the static and dynamic options, given the ambiguous results
        across platforms, compilers, model configurations, ect.</p>

        <p>The documentation of most Fortran modules in FMS is
        inserted right in the source code to enable consistency
        between the code and documentation. A Perl software tool is
        used to extract documentation from the source code to
        create a corresponding html module. For example,
        documentation for shared/diag_manager/diag_manager.F90
        module is shared/diag_manager/diag_manager.html. In
        general, the embedded documentation is a good starting
        point to understand the Fortran module, though ultimately
        the Fortran code is the final source for information.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Although MOM4 shares much in common with earlier
        versions of MOM, it possesses a number of computational,
        numerical, and physical characteristics that are
        noteworthy. The following provides an overview of the main
        characteristics of MOM4 (please refer to <a href=
        "./guide4p0.pdf" target="_top">A Technical Guide to
        MOM4</a> and <a href="./guide4p1.pdf" target=
        "_top">Elements of MOM4p1</a> for references).</p>

        <p>Computational characteristics of MOM4 include the
        following.</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>MOM4 is coded in Fortran 90 and physical units are
            MKS.</li>

            <li>MOM4 meets the code standards set by the GFDL
            Flexible Modeling System (<a href=
            "http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms" target="_top">FMS</a>).
            It also utilizes a substantial number of software
            infrastructure modules shared by other FMS-based
            models. In particular, all I/O (e.g., restarts, forcing
            fields, initial fields) is handled via <a href=
            "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/" target=
            "_top">NetCDF</a>.</li>

            <li>There are very few cpp-preprocessor option (i.e.,
            <tt class="option">ifdefs</tt>). One is associated with
            the handling of memory in the model (denoted
            MOM4_STATIC_ARRAYS in MOM4p1). Another option enables
            the suite of tracers associated with the MOM4p1
            implementation of the GFDL ocean biogeochemistry model.
            The reason for including this second ifdef is to
            minimize the compile time required for the many cases
            when one chooses NOT to use the biogeochemistry (adding
            the biogeochemistry greatly lengthens the compile
            time). Other options for vertical coordinates, physical
            parameterizations, and dynamical choices are handled
            via namelists and/or settings within tables. Removing
            <tt class="option">ifdefs</tt> allows for more readable
            code that possesses a higher level of error checker
            handling. It also facilitates testing various
            algorithms using the same executable.</li>

            <li>2D (latitudinal/longitudinal) horizontal domain
            decomposition is used for single or multiple parallel
            processors. Correspondingly, 3D arrays are dimensioned
            (i,j,k) instead of the (i,k,j) structure used in MOM3
            and earlier. Notably, MOM4 has no memory window or
            slabs.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Numerical and kinematic/dynamic characteristics of
        MOM4p0 and MOM4p1 include the following. For a more
        complete discussion of the differences between MOM4p0 and
        MOM4p1, please refer to <a href="./mom4p1_synopsis.pdf"
        target="_top">this link for a synopsis</a>.</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Generalized orthogonal horizontal coordinates are
            used. GFDL is supporting both the standard spherical
            coordinates as well as the ''tripolar'' grid of Murray
            (1996). Details are provided in <a href=
            "./guide4p0.pdf" target="_top">A Technical Guide to
            MOM4</a>.</li>

            <li>Bottom topography is generally represented using
            the partial cells of Pacanowski and Gnanadesikan
            (1998). The older full cell approach is available as a
            namelist in the preprocessing code used to generate the
            grid specification file.</li>

            <li>The dynamics/kinematics for MOM4p0a and MOM4p0b are
            based on the non-Boussinesq method of Greatbatch et al.
            (2002). The Boussinesq option is available via a
            namelist. This option was jettisoned in MOM4p0c and
            MOM4p0d for purposes of code brevity, anticipating the
            move to pressure vertical coordinates. In MOM4p1, the
            non-Boussinesq dynamics and kinematics is available via
            pressure-based vertical coordinates. Formulational and
            algorithmic details are provided in <a href=
            "./guide4p1.pdf" target="_top">Elements of
            MOM4p1</a>.</li>

            <li>In MOM4p0, the sole vertical coordinate is the
            geopotential coordinate. In MOM4p1, the six following
            vertical coordinates are available: geopotential,
            zstar, terrain following, pressure, pstar, and terrain
            following pressure. Formulational and algorithmic
            details are provided in <a href="./guide4p1.pdf"
            target="_top">Elements of MOM4p1</a>. Refer to <a href=
            "./mom4p1_synopsis.pdf" target="_top">this document</a>
            for a synopsis of the new vertical coordinates
            available in MOM4p1.</li>

            <li>The time tendency for tracer and baroclinic
            velocity can be discretized two ways. (1) The first
            approach uses the traditional leap-frog method along
            with a Robert-Asselin time filter. This method is
            available in MOM4p0a, MOM4p0b and MOM4p0c. Note that
            the Euler forward or Euler backward mixing time step
            used in earlier MOMs has been eliminated. (2) MOM4p0c
            and later releases provide an additional time stepping
            method, which is strongly recommended and now
            universally used at GFDL. Here, the time tendency is
            discretized with a two-level forward step, which
            eliminates the need to time filter. Tracer and velocity
            are staggered in time. For certain model
            configurations, this scheme is roughly twice as stable
            as the leap-frog, thus allowing for a factor of two in
            computational savings. Without the time filtering
            needed with the leap-frog, the new scheme conserves
            total tracer to within numerical roundoff. This scheme
            shares much in common with time stepping used in the
            GFDL General Ocean Layer Dynamics (GOLD) and the MIT
            GCM. It is the default in MOM4p0c and more recent
            releases. Details of both the leap-frog and two-level
            schemes are provided in <a href=
            "http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html" target=
            "_top">Fundamentals of Ocean Climate Models</a>.</li>

            <li>The sole external mode solver is a variant of the
            Griffies et al. (2001) explicit free surface. There are
            two time stepping schemes supported: (1) leap-frog and
            (2) predictor-corrector. The predictor-corrector is
            more stable and is thus the default method. All model
            grid cells have time dependent volume (Boussinesq) or
            mass (nonBoussinesq), thus allowing for total tracer to
            be conserved to within numerical roundoff. The
            linearized free surface method used in MOM3 (and many
            other implementations of the free surface in z-models)
            has been jettisoned since it precludes precise tracer
            conservation. Details are provided in <a href=
            "http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html" target=
            "_top">Fundamentals of Ocean Climate Models</a> as well
            as <a href="./guide4p1.pdf" target="_top">Elements of
            MOM4p1</a>.</li>

            <li>McDougall et al. (2003) equation of state has been
            implemented in MOM4p0, with in situ density a function
            of the local potential temperature, salinity, and
            hydrostatic pressure (baroclinic pressure plus free
            surface pressure plus applied pressure from the
            atmosphere and sea ice). Details are provided in
            <a href="http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html"
            target="_top">Fundamentals of Ocean Climate Models</a>.
            The Jackett etal. (2006) equation of state is
            implemented in MOM4p1, with the Conservative
            Temperature variable from McDougall (2005) also
            available. Details are provided in <a href=
            "./guide4p1.pdf" target="_top">Elements of
            MOM4p1</a>.</li>

            <li>Tracer advection is available using various
            schemes. The centered 2nd, 4th, 6th order schemes are
            available, as documented in <a href=
            "http://www.gfdl.gov/~smg/MOM/web/guide_parent/guide_parent.html"
            target="_top">The MOM3 Manual of Pacanowski and
            Griffies (1999)</a>. The 4th and 6th order schemes
            assume constant grid spacing, which simplifies the code
            though compromises accuracy on the more commonly used
            non-uniform grids. The Quicker scheme documented by
            Holland et al. (1998) and <a href=
            "http://www.gfdl.gov/~smg/MOM/web/guide_parent/guide_parent.html"
            target="_top">The MOM3 Manual</a> is available. Two
            multi-dimensional flux limited schemes have been ported
            from the MIT GCM. These schemes are monotonic and have
            been found to be roughly the same cost as the Quicker
            scheme. GFDL researchers have found the Sweby scheme to
            be satisfying for many applications, such as
            biogeochemistry. Hence, effort has been made to enhance
            this scheme's efficiency in MOM4p0c. In MOM4p1, the
            flux limited as well as unlimited scheme from Prather
            (1986) is available. This scheme has been found to be
            quite accurate, though requires the addition of many
            three-dimensional arrays per tracer. Finally, a
            multi-dimensional piecewise parabolic scheme (MDPPM)

            <li>Tidal forcing from the various lunar and solar
            components are available to force the free ocean
            surface. Details are provided in <a href=

            <li>Open boundary conditions are available to allow
            open boundaries in either of the north, south, east, or
            west directions. This module has been extensively
            rewritten for purposes of code generality, with
            numerous new options for radiating conditions. This

            <li>Neutral tracer physics includes Redi neutral
            diffusion according to Griffies et al. (1998), and
            Gent-McWilliams stirring according to the Griffies
            (1998) skew-flux method. Two-dimensional flow dependent
            diffusivities are available and can be determined in
            many different ways, such as the depth integrated Eady
            growth rate and Rossby radius of deformation, as
            motivated by the ideas of Held and Larichev (1996) and
            Visbeck et al. (1997). Details are provided in <a href=

            MOM4p1, the treatment of neutral physics near the

            <li>In addition to the implementation of
            Gent-McWilliams as a skew tracer diffusion, MOM4p1
            provides options which transforms these effects into
            the momentum equation. The standard method for this
            transformation is via the approach of Greatbatch and
            Lamb (1990) and Greatbatch (1998), in which the
            vertical viscosity is modified. Another approach is due
            to Aiki, Jacobson, and Yamagata (2004), in which
            momentum is dissipative with a Rayleigh-like drag term.
            This latter approach from Aiki etal is experimental and
            not recommended for general usage.</li>

            <li>Vertical mixing schemes include the
            time-independent depth profile of Bryan and Lewis
            (1979), the Richardson number dependent scheme of
            Pacanowski and Philander (1981), the KPP scheme of
            Large et al. (1994), and in MOM4p1 the <a href=

            Turbulence Model (GOTM)</a> is also available.</li>

            <li>Horizontal friction schemes include uniform and
            grid dependent viscosity schemes, as well as the
            shear-dependent Smagorinsky viscosity according to
            Griffies and Hallberg (2000). The anisotropic scheme of
            Large et al. (2001) and Smith and McWilliams (2002) has
            been implemented. Details are provided in <a href=

            <li>Topographically oriented tracer diffusion
            introduces enhanced diffusion when heavy parcels are
            above lighter parcels. It is implemented according to
            the ideas of Beckmann and D&#246;scher (1997) and

            <li>The "overflow" scheme of Campin and Goosse (1999)
            has been implemented, whereby gravitationally unstable
            fluid parcels are allowed to move downslope via an
            upwind advection scheme. Details are provided in

            <li>Modifications to the Campin and Goosse (1999)
            scheme have been implemented in MOM4p1 that allow for
            the transport of tracers to horizontally distant
            columns, so long as such is density favored. Details
            are provided in <a href="./guide4p1.pdf" target=

            <li>Penetration of shortwave radiative heating into the
            upper ocean is generally attenuated by the inclusion of
            chlorophyll data (MOM4p0), or via chlorophyll data or
            an active biogeochemistry model (MOM4p1). Details are

        numerous FMS infrastructure and superstructure modules that
        are shared amongst various atmospheric, ocean, sea ice,
        land, vegetative, etc. models. Common standards and shared
        software tools facilitate the development of high-end earth
        system models, which necessarily involves a wide variety of
        researchers working on different computational platforms.
        Such standards also foster efficient input from
        computational scientists and engineers as they can more
        readily focus on common computational issues.</p>

      <p>MOM4 is distributed with code used to generate model
      grids, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. Each step
      must be performed prior to running the ocean model. The steps
      used during this experimental setup stage are generally
      termed "preprocessing", and the code used for these purposes
      is under the /preprocessing directory in the MOM4
      distribution. The purpose of this section of the User Guide
      is to outline this code and its usage. Further details of
      usage and algorithms can be found in the internal
      documentation within the various preprocessing code
      modules.</p>

        </div>

        <p>We start this section with some general comments
        regarding the setup of a model experiment.</p>

        <p>--Setting up an experiment is critical part to the
        success of a research or development project with MOM4. It
        is important that the user take some time to understand
        each of the many steps, and scrutinize the output from this
        code.</p>

        <p>We have endeavored over the years to provide tools
        facilitating the ready setup of a new experiment. However,
        we remain unable to provide code that does everything
        possible under the sun. Additionally, all features that are
        provided here may not be fully tested. For these reasons,
        the preprocessing code continues to evolve as use and
        functionality evolve. We sincerely appreciate ALL comments
        about code and documentation, especially comments regarding
        clarity, completeness, and correctness. Your input is
        essential for the improvement of the code and
        documentation.</p>

        <p>--Many steps in idealized experiments that were formerly
        performed while running earlier MOM versions have been
        extracted from MOM4 and placed into preprocessing. Hence,
        even if you are running an idealized experiment, it is
        likely that you will need to perform some if not all of the
        preprocessing steps discussed here.</p>

        <p>--If you have a problem that is not addressed here, then
        please feel free to query the MOM4 email list. No question
        is too silly, so please ask!</p>

        <p>--All code used to setup an experiment with MOM4 is
        written in Fortran 90/95 except make_xgrids, which is
        written in C. Most code is dependent on FMS shared code for
        the purpose of parallization and interpolation. In addition
        to the documentation provided here, there are comments
        within the code to help users debug and to make
        modifications to suit their purpose.</p>

        <p>--Some users make nontrivial changes of general use.
        With your support, assistance, and maintenance, we will
        endeavour to include your changes in future releases.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Mosaics is the name given to a general framework to
        define structured grids at GFDL. The details of this scheme
        are being incorporated by others outside of GFDL as well.
        Most of the recent global models developed at GFDL employ
        the conventions of Mosaic. However, MOM4p1 is backwards
        compatible, so that it still supports grids generated with
        older software (discussed <a href=
        "#Creation%20of%20the%20ocean/ice%20grid%20(mosaics)"
        target="_top">here</a>) For a description of how to create
        grids using the newer Mosaic tools, which are more general
        than the older approaches, then please access <a href=

              <h3 class="title"><a name=
              "Creation of the ocean/ice grid (pre-mosaics)"></a>5.3.&nbsp;Creation

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Within GFDL FMS, ocean and ice are assumed to share the
        same grid. This means that the two models read in the same
        grid specification file. Even so, the domain decomposition
        on parallel systems may be different, and indeed they
        generally are due to different load balance issues between
        the two models.</p>

        <p>Even though the ocean and ice models read the same grid
        specification file, they use the information from the grid
        file in a slightly different manner when setting up the
        respective model's tracer grid. In particular, the ocean
        model reads the tracer location directly from the arrays
        (x_T/geolon_t, y_T/geolat_t) written in the grid
        specification file. In contrast, the GFDL ice model reads
        (x_vert_T/geolon_vert_t, y_vert_T/geolat_vert_t) from the
        grid specification file and then averages these four vertex
        locations to get the tracer location used in the ice model.
        The result is that diagnostics output from the two models
        have ocean and ice fields at slightly different locations
        for cases such as the tripolar grid when the grid is not
        spherical.</p>

        <p>The ocean/ice grid specification file is generated by
        executing the ocean_grid_generator utility. The
        ocean_grid_generator utility generates the horizontal grid,
        vertical grid, and topography. A C-shell script is provided
        to compile relevant code to generate and run the executable
        to produce the grid file. To create the desired grid and
        topography, setting namelist options within the runscript
        is needed.</p>

        <p>The horizontal grid can be conventional lon-lat
        spherical grid or a reprojected rotated tripolar grid (R.
        Murray, "Explicit generation of orthogonal grids for ocean
        models", 1996, J.Comp.Phys., v. 126, p. 251-273.). The
        choice is controlled by the namelist option "tripolar grid"
        (true for tripolar grid and false for lon-lat spherical
        grid). Note that Cartesian beta-plane and f-plane
        geometries are set up within MOM4, not within the grid
        generation preprocessing steps discussed here (see
        mom4/ocean_core/ocean_grids.F90 for beta-plane and f-plane
        namelist options).</p>

        <p>The grid_spec file contains the following horizontal
        grid information: geographic location of T,E,C and N-cell
        (Tracer, East, Corner, and North cells), half and full cell
        lengths (in meters), rotation information between logical
        (i.e., grid oriented) and geographic east of cell. The
        complete description of the horizontal grid and namelist
        option is available in <a href=
        "../../preprocessing/generate_grids/ocean/hgrid.html"
        target="_top">hgrid</a></p>

        <p>The vertical grid information includes depth of tracer
        points and tracer_boundaries. The complete description of
        namelist option is available in <a href=
        "../../preprocessing/generate_grids/ocean/vgrid.html"
        target="_top">vgrid</a></p>

        <p>The topography can be idealized (various examples are
        provided and others can be easily added through emulating
        those provided) or remapped from a source topography
        dataset. The type of topography is specified by the
        namelist variable "topography". Namelist
        "topog_depend_on_vgrid" specifies if the topography will
        depend on the vertical grid or not. To generate a grid for
        MOM4, "topog_depend_on_vgrid" should always be true. A
        useful option for those upgrading older models to MOM4 is
        "adjust_topo". If this option is set to false, there will
        be no adjustments made to the topography. See <a href=
        "../../preprocessing/generate_grids/ocean/topog.html"
        target="_top">topog</a> for further details about
        topography namelist options.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>"Exchange grid" information is required for coupled
        models (i.e., ocean/ice coupled to land and/or atmosphere)
        that employ the GFDL coupler technology. The exchange grid
        is defined by taking the union of the ocean/ice grid with
        the atmosphere and land grids. This union is then used to
        compute area integrals to allow for conservative mapping of
        fluxes between the component models.</p>

        <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src=
        "./land_surgery.gif" align="right" width="140" alt=
        "The Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon clipping algorithm for model cell interaction calculation"></span>
        The exchange grid information is generated by executing the
        make_xgrids utility. The execution of the make_xgrids
        utility will generate a netcdf file with the name
        grid_spec.nc. The grid_spec.nc contains the component model
        grids as well as the exchange grid information. In
        particular, the utility make_xgrids generates two exchange
        grids used by the FMS coupler: one grid for surface fluxes
        and another for runoff. <span><b class=
        "command">make_xgrids</b></span> is created by compiling
        its C source:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
cc -O -o make_xgrids make_xgrids.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib 
-lnetcdf -lm
</pre>

        <p>creates the make_xgrids executable from C-source and the
        netCDF and standard math libraries. It is executed with the
        command</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a atmos_grid.nc -l land_grid.nc
</pre>

        <p>This execution produces a grid_spec.nc file (input files
        containing grid information for the ocean/sea-ice,
        atmosphere and land component models are indicated by the
        -o, -a and -l flags, respectively). The grid files
        ocean_grid.nc, atmosphere_grid.nc, and land_grid.nc all can
        be generated separately through the ocean_grid_generator
        utility. Normally at GFDL we select the same atmosphere and
        land model grid, but such is not necessary. When the land
        and atmosphere grids are the same, then we can reduce the
        execute command to</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a atmos_grid.nc
</pre>

        <p>If you further decide to choose same ocean, atmosphere
        and land grid, the execute command will be</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a ocean_grid.nc
</pre>

        <p>make_xgrids expects a netCDF format input specification
        for each of the component model grid files. For the
        ice/ocean grid (ocean_grid.nc), the following three fields
        are required:</p>

        <p>1. wet - a 2D array of double precision numbers set to
        1.0 where the ice and ocean models are active and 0.0
        elsewhere. wet has im indices in the i-direction (pseudo
        east-west) and jm indices in the j-direction (pseudo
        north-south). These correspond to the size of the global
        arrays of temperature, salinity and ice thickness in the
        coupled climate model.</p>

        <p>2. x_vert_T and y_vert_T - 3D double precision arrays
        (dimensioned im * jm * 4) that contain the longitudes and
        latitudes (respectively) of the four corners of T- cells.
        The numbers are in degrees.</p>

        <p>For the netCDF format input specification for the
        atmosphere and land grid (atmos_grid.nc and/or
        land_grid.nc), x_vert_T and y_vert_t are required.</p>

        <p><span><b class="command">make_xgrids</b></span> copies
        all fields of the ice/ocean grid specification file to its
        output file, grid_spec.nc, and then appends fields that
        specify the atmosphere and land model grids and then the
        surface and runoff exchange grids.</p>

        <p>Using the Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon clipping algorithm
        (reference in next paragraph) for model cell interaction
        calculation, make_xgrids takes care that the land and ocean
        grids perfectly tile the sphere. The land model's domain is
        defined as that part of the sphere not covered by ocean
        (where wet=0 on the ocean grid). To accomplish this, the
        land cells must be modified to remove the ocean parts. This
        is done in make_xgrids by first taking the intersections of
        atmosphere and land cells. The overlap area between these
        cells and active ocean cells are then subtracted. Finally,
        the modified atmosphere/land intersections are aggregated
        into land cell areas and atmosphere/land exchange cell
        areas.</p>

        <p>Model cell intersections are calculated using the
        Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon clipping algorithm (Sutherland,
        I. E. and G. W. Hodgeman, 1974: Reentrant polygon clipping,
        CACM, 17(1), 32-42.). This algorithm finds the intersection
        of a convex and arbitrary polygon by successively removing
        the portion of the latter that is "outside" each boundary
        of the former. It can be found in many computer graphics
        text books (e.g., Foley, J. D., A. van Dam, S. K. Feiner,
        and J. F. Hughes, 1990: Computer graphics: principles and
        practice, second edition. Addison Wesley, 1174 pp.). The
        implementation in make_xgrids is particularly simple
        because the clipping polygon is always a rectangle in
        longitude/latitude space. For the purpose of finding the
        line intersections in the clipping operations, the cell
        boundaries are assumed to be straight lines in
        longitude/latitude space. This treatment is only perfectly
        accurate for cells bounded by lines of longitude and
        latitude.</p>

        <p>Spherical areas are calculated by taking the integral of
        the negative sine of latitude around the boundary of a
        polygon (Jones, P. W., 1999: First- and second-order
        conservative remapping schemes for grids in spherical
        coordinates. Monthly Weather Review, 127, 2204-2210.). The
        integration pathways are again straight lines in
        longitude/latitude space. make_xgrids checks that the
        sphere and the individual cells of the atmosphere and ocean
        grids are tiled by the surface exchange cells. The
        fractional tiling errors are reported.</p>

        the initial and boundary conditions (ICs and BCs). These
        conditions are specific to the details of the model grid,
        so it is necessary to have the grid specificiation file in
        hand before moving to the IC and BC generation.</p>

        <p>There are two options for ICs and BCs.</p>

        <p>--Idealized Conditions. These conditions are based on
        subroutines that design idealized setups for either initial
        conditions (e.g., exponential temperature profile) or
        boundary conditions (e.g., cosine zonal wind stress). Code
        for these purposes is found in the idealized_ic and
        idealized_bc directories in the MOM4 distribution. Details
        of available namelist choices are in the documentation file
        idealized_ic.html as well as the comments within the source
        code itself. Users can readily incorporate their favorite
        idealized IC or BC into the MOM4 idealized preprocessing
        step by emulating the code provided.</p>

        <p>--Realistic Conditions. These ICs and BCs generally
        result from a regridding routine to bring, say, the Levitus
        analysis onto the model grid for initializing a model, or
        for mapping surface fluxes onto the grid for boundary
        conditions. Code enabling the regridding functions is found
        in the preprocessing/regrid_2d, preprocessing/regrid_3d and
        preprocessing/regrid directories in the MOM4
        distribution.</p>

        <p>In the remainder of this section, we detail code to
        generate the ICs and BCs of use for MOM4.</p>

          <p>It is typical for air-sea fluxes of momentum, heat,
          and mosture to live on a grid distinct from the ocean
          model grid. In particular, most analysis are placed on a
          spherical latitude-longitude grid, whereas most global
          ocean models configured from MOM4 are run with tripolar
          grids.</p>

          <p>When running an ocean or ocean-ice model, it is useful
          to map the boundary fluxes onto the ocean model grid
          prior to the experiment. This preprocessing step saves
          computational time that would otherwise be needed if the
          fluxes were mapped each time step of a running
          experiment. To enable this regridding, one should access
          code in the preprocessing/regrid_2d directory. The
          original data must be on a latitude-longitude grid to use
          regrid_2d. The target/destination grid can be either
          latitude-longitude with arbitrary resolution, or tripolar
          with arbitrary resolution.</p>

          <p>In some cases, one may wish to take a set of forcing
          fields from one tripolar MOM4 experiment and regrid them
          onto another tripolar MOM4 experiment with different grid
          resolution. In this case, it is necessary to regrid
          before running the experiment.</p>

          <p>As of the MOM4p0d distribution, there is a regridding
          tool within the preprocessing/regrid directory that
          enables one to regrid fields on one tripolar grid to
          another tripolar grid. Indeed, one can regrid source data
          from any logically rectangular grid (e.g.,
          latitude-longitude grid or tripolar grid) to a
          target/destination grid that is any logically rectangular
          grid.</p>

          <p>Note that this is new code, and so has been tested
          only for particular cases. So the user should be extra
          careful to scrutinize the results.</p>

          <p>The "on_grid" logical in the data_table indicates

          <p>on_grid=.true. means that the input file is on the
          same grid as the ocean model. This is the recommended
          setting for models running with specified atmospheric
          forcing from data or an analysis product.</p>

          <p>on_grid=.false. means the input file has data on a
          grid differing from the ocean model. This feature is
          allowed ONLY if the input data lives on a spherical grid.
          This is a relevant setting if one wishes to keep the
          input data on their native spherical grid. If the input
          data is non-spherical, then on_grid=.false. is NOT

          <p>The tool preprocessing/runoff_regrid is of use to grid
          river runoff data onto the ocean model grid. In this
          case, runoff is moved to a nearest ocean/land boundary
          point on the new grid. Note that the source runoff
          dataset must be on a spherical latitude-longitude grid,
          whereas the target/destination grid can be spherical or
          tripolar. The regridding algorithm is conservative.</p>

          <p>The conservative regridding scheme used in
          runoff_regrid is an area average scheme, which is
          similiar to the algorithm used in coupler flux exchange.
          If any land point has runoff data, after remapping runoff
          data onto destination grid, the runoff value of that land
          point will be moved to the nearest ocean point. Before
          using this tool, you must use make_xgrids to generate
          exchange grid information between the source grid and
          destination grid. The complete description can be found

          <p>There are two ways to specify surface boundary fluxes
          when using the coupler feature of FMS. One is through
          flux exchange, and this employs a conservative algorithm
          as appropriate for running a coupled ocean-atmosphere
          model. It is assumed that the atmospheric model grid is
          spherical with arbitrary resolution. The other method is
          through data override, and this uses a non-conservative
          scheme. Data override is of use to selectively remove,
          say, one of the fluxes coming from an atmospheric model
          and replace this flux with that from data. GFDL modelers
          have found this feature to be very useful in diagnosing
          problems with a coupled model.</p>

          <p>When generating realistic initial conditions for an
          ocean experiment, one generally requires the gridding of
          temperature and salinity, such as from the Levitus
          analysis product, onto the model's grid. For this
          purpose, we are in need of vertical grid information in
          addition to horizontal 2d information required for the
          surface boundary conditions. Hence, we use the
          preprocessing/regrid_3d. A similar procedure is required
          to develop sponge data.</p>

          <p>The original data must be on a spherical grid in order
          to use regrid_3d. If the original data is on a tripolar
          grid, we should use preprocessing/regrid, which can map
          data from any logical rectangular grid onto any logical
          rectangular grid.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>For preprocessing/regrid_3d, preprocessing/regrid_2d
          and preprocessing/regrid, regridding is accomplished
          non-conservatively using a nearest neighbor distance
          weighting algorithm, or bilinear interpolation. The
          interpolation algorithm is controlled through the
          namelist option "interp_method".</p>

          <p>Bilinear interpolation is recommanded for most cases
          since it provides a smooth interpolation when regridding
          from coarse grid to fine grid (the usual situation with
          model destination grids typically having resolution more
          refined than source data products), and it is more
          efficient. Efficiency can become a particularly important
          issue when developing initial and boundary conditions for
          a refined resolution model.</p>

          <p>If the original data is on a tripolar grid, nearest
          neighbor distance weighting interpolation found in
          preprocessing/regrid must be used, since bilinear
          interpolation assumes the original data is on a
          latitude-longitude grid. For preprocessing/regrid_2d,
          preprocessing/regrid_3d and preprocessing/regrid using
          the nearest neighbor distance weighting algorithm, a
          maximum distance (in radians) can be selected using the
          namelist value max_dist. Namelist option "num_nbrs" can
          be adjusted for speed, although for most applications
          this refinement is not necessary.</p>

          <p>The complete namelist description for these algorithms
          can be found in regrid_2d.html, regrid_3d.html and

          </div>
        </div>There are many ways that data can be formatted in
        time. The FMS tools used to read in time information, and
        to time interpolate, are quite sophisticated and flexible.
        Nonetheless, these tools cannot do everything, nor can they
        know a priori what the modeler intends. It is therefore
        necessary to maintain certain conventions when preparing
        the time information for datasets. This section aims to
        outline some of the common issues involved with time, and
        to provide a guide for resolving possible problems.

          <p>Previous versions of MOM used IEEE binary formats and
          MOM-specific headers to process forcing data. As of MOM4,
          data are stored in portable formats (NetCDF currently),
          and contain standardized metadata per the <a href=
          "http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/" target=

          <p>Understading the functions of Fortran modules that
          handle metadata and time-related problems will be very
          helpful in identifying some user's problems. Some of the

          <p>It is likely that you will encounter an error using
          "off-the-shelf" NetCDF files to force your ocean model.
          This could be due to inadequate metadata in the forcing
          files, mis-specification of the DataTable, or errors in
          the parsing of the axis information by axis_utils or
          get_cal_time. You'll need some tools to help you diagnose
          problems and apply the required fix.</p>

          <p>The first thing you should do to setup a new forcing
          file is use the test program: <span><b class=
          "command">time_interp_external_mod:test_time_interp_external</b></span>.
          This test program calls time_interp_external at
          user-specified model times and returns information on how
          the times were decoded and the resulting interpolation
          indices and weights. It is STRONGLY suggested that you
          pass your forcing files through this program before
          including them in your model configuration. As you gain
          familiarity with the metadata requirements, you will more
          easily be able to identify errors and save a lot of time
          debugging.</p>

          somewhat cryptic error message: "file/fieldname could not

          solution is to add the "cartesian_axis" attribute to the

          <p>This is a required attribute.
          time_manager_mod:get_cal_time converts time units
          appropriate to the specified calendar to the model time
          representation. If the "calendar" attribute does not
          exist, an error message appears "get_cal_time: calendar
          attribute required. Check your dataset to make sure
          calendar attribute exists " Use a ncatted command such
          as: "ncatted -a calendar,time_axis_name,c,c,"julian"
          foo.nc"</p>

          <p>Currently, the FMS time_manager does not support the
          Gregorian calendar. So, for instance if you have forcing
          data that are encoded using the Gregorian calendar which
          has an average year length of 365.2425 days compared with
          the Julian calendar with an average year length of 365.25
          days, assuming Julian calendar encoding will result in a
          drift of 0.75 days/100 years. If your forcing times are
          referenced to an early date such as "0001-01-01" your
          times will drift by 15 days by the year 2000. Until the
          Gregorian calendar is implemented in the FMS code, the
          recommended solution is to change the reference date in
          the forcing dataset using an application such as
          Ferret</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Scalability of a complex model like MOM4 is the
        correlation between the number of processing elements (PE)
        and the run time. One would expect that run time decreases
        as the number of PEs increases. It is important, however,
        to note that there are a number of important factors that
        can affect scalability considerably:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>MOM4 test cases are designed for testing the code
            integrity, they are not set for scalability study or
            "production" purpose. Changes should be made if one
            wants to study scalability of the code.</li>

            <li>diag_freq (in MOM4p0) and diag_step (in MOM4p1) set
            the time steps at which numerical diagnostics (e.g.,
            energy, tracer budgets) are computed. The user needs to
            set this value to be equal to the time step at the end
            of the experiment, so that only a single instance of
            the diagnostics is evaluated. For example, if time step
            is 1 hour and run length is 4 days, diag_freq in MOM4p0
            (diag_step in MOM4p1) should be set to 96.</li>

            <li>diag_table contains all fields that will be saved
            in history files. The frequency of saving and number of
            fields can afect the total run time greatly. So when
            testing performance, it is recommended that the
            researcher reduce the output of history files.</li>

            <li>Scalability is also dependent on the configuration
            of the computing platform: Ethernet card, interconnect
            between PEs, implementation of MPI, memory hierarchy,
            version of compiler, ...</li>

            <li>In examining the total run time the overheads due
            to initialization and termination should be extracted
            from total runtime for scalability study since they
            contain a lot of I/O activities.</li>

              Minimizing idle processors</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>When running an ocean-ice model with atmospheric data
        forcing, it may happen that some ocean-ice tasks contain
        only land points, in which case these processors stand
        idle. FMS provides a feature to mask land-only tasks and to
        thus run the model without allocating a processor for these
        land-only domains. For example, if a processor domain
        layout 30x50 is specified, but say 500 subdomains are land
        only, you may run the model with 1500-500=1000 MPI tasks
        only. Note that you do not get your results faster when
        eliminating land-only processors, but compute costs may be
        reduced.</p>

        <p>In the following example, an "x" represents a land-only
        subdomain, whereas a dot indicates a domain with a nonzero
        number of "wet" ocean points:</p>

        <p>x . x</p>

        <p>x . .</p>

        <p>. . .</p>

        <p>In this example, three idle processors could be left out
        (two in the northern-most row, and one in the second row)
        since there are no wet ocean points on these "x" domains.
        The ocean-ice model may thus be run with only 6 MPI tasks
        rather than nine. To enable this feature of FMS, the
        following variables in the namelist coupler_nml must be
        specified.</p>

        <p>coupler_nml</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>do_atmos = .false.</p>

        <p>....</p>

        <p>n_mask = 3</p>

        <p>layout_mask = 3, 3</p>

        <p>mask_list = 1,2, 1,3, 3,3</p>

        <p>If a mask list is specified, the domain layout of the
        ocean and the ice model is automatically the same, as
        specified with layout_mask. Running the model, only 6 MPI
        tasks need to be started.</p>

        <p>For large and complex model topography, it is very
        tedious to specify the mask list by hand. To simplify this
        task, the preprocessing tool "check_mask" can be used after
        the model grid and topography are specified, i.e., when
        grid_spec.nc is generated. To do so requires adding the
        following to topog_nml during the preprocessing stage</p>

        <p>topog_nml</p>

        <p>check_mask=.true.</p>

        <p>The preprocessing code prints out a number of proposals
        for possible domain layouts, number of land-only
        subdomains, and templates for setting the mask_list. You
        may copy these layouts to coupler_nml, but note that you
        must replace spaces by a comma in "mask_list".</p>

        <p>You may configure "check_mask" from the namelist
        check_mask_nml. There are two variables "max_pe" and "halo"
        required to perform the mask checking. The default settings
        are</p>

        <p>max_pe = 128 halo = 1</p>

        <p>If you intend to employ more processors, then increase
        max_pe. If you want to use higher order advection schemes,
        then increase halo to halo=2 or even halo=3. Otherwise, the
        halo information of masked domains may leak into ocean
        domains, in which case the model will fail, with errors
        reporting land values at ocean points.</p>

        <p>In the postprocessing step, the single netCDF-output
        files from the MPI tasks can be combined into one file
        using the tool <a href="#mppnccombine" target=
        "_top">mppnccombine</a>. The latest version adds "missing"
        values at the location of land-only domains. Hence, the
        only remaining trace of masking out land-only processors is
        in your account files, where some compute time is
        saved.</p>

        <p>For many analysis applications, it is sufficient, and
        often preferable, to have output on the model's native grid
        (i.e., the grid used to run the simulation). Accurate
        computation of budgets, for example, must be done on the
        model's native grid, preferably online during integration.
        MOM4 provides numerous online diagnostics for this
        purpose.</p>

        <p>Many applications, such as model comparison projects,
        require results on a common latitude-longitude spherical
        grid. Such facilitates the development of difference maps.
        For this purpose, we have developed a tool to regrid scalar
        and vector fields from a tripolar grid to a spherical grid.
        In principle, this tool can be used to regrid any logically
        rectangular gridded field onto a spherical grid. However,
        applications at GFDL have been limited to the tripolar to
        spherical regrid case.</p>

        <p>In general, regridding is a difficult task to perform
        accurately and without producing noise or spurious results.
        The user should carefully examine regridding results for
        their physical integrity. Problems occur, in particular,
        with fields near MOM4's partial bottom step topography in
        the presence of realistic topography and land/sea geometry.
        Indeed, we were unable to find a simple algorithm to handle
        regridding in the vertical that did not produce egregious
        levels of noise. Hence, the regridding tool provided with
        MOM4 only handles horizontal regridding. The regridded data
        will thus be on the source vertical grid.</p>

        <p>Model comparisons should ideally be performed only after
        regridding output using the same regridding algorithm.
        Unfortunately, such is not generally the case since there
        is no standard regridding algorithm used in the modeling
        community.</p>

        <p>The regridding algorithm provided with the MOM4
        distribution is located in the directory <span><b class=
        "command">postprocessing/regrid</b></span></p>

        <p>The algorithm accepts data from any logically
        rectangular grid (e.g., tripolar or latitude-longitude) and
        regrids to a spherical latitude-longitude grid. When the
        data is on the tracer cell (T-cell), the regridding
        interpolation is conservative. Thus, total heat, salt, and
        passive tracer remain the same on the two grids. However,
        when data is located at another position:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>corner or C-cell as for a B-grid horizontal
            velocity component</li>

            <li>east or E-cell as for an eastward tracer flux</li>

            <li>north or N-cell as for a northward tracer flux</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>then regridding is accomplished non-conservatively using
        a nearest neighbor distance weighting algorithm. It is for
        this reason that computationally accurate results are only
        available when working on the model's native grids.</p>

        <p>The regridding tool reads grids information from a
        netcdf file, specified by the namelist "grid_spec_file".
        "grid_spec_file" contains source grid, destination grid and
        exchange grid information.</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>source grid: src_grid.nc. This is the model's
            native grid. It results from running preprocessing grid
            generation code.</li>

            <li>destination grid: dst_grid.nc. This is the
            spherical latitude-lontitude grid. This grid can also
            be obtained from running preprocessing grid generation
            code. Be sure that the tripolar option is set to false
            to ensure that dst_grid.nc is spherical.</li>

            <li>exchange grid: grid_spec.nc. This is the union of
            the source grid and destination grid. The exchange grid
            is needed for conservative regridding. The same
            conservative regridding algorithm is used for coupled
            models with FMS. The tool to construct the exchange
            grid is know as "make_xgrids". It is located in the
            preprocessing directory. After grid_spec.nc is
            generated, it should be passed to the regrid tool
            through namelist "grid_spec_file"(No need to pass
            src_grid.nc and dst_grid.nc to the regrid tool).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>To create the exchange grid, execute the command</p>

        <p><span><b class="command">make_xgrids -o src_grid.nc -a
        dst_grid.nc</b></span></p>

        <p>The exchange grid creates a file grid_spec.nc. It has
        new fields with names:</p>

        <p>AREA_ATMxOCN, DI_ATMxOCN, DJ_ATMxOCN, I_ATM_ATMxOCN,
        J_ATM_ATMxOCN, I_OCN_ATMxOCN, J_OCN_ATMxOCN, AREA_ATMxLND,
        DI_ATMxLND, DJ_ATMxLND, I_ATM_ATMxLND, J_ATM_ATMxLND,
        I_LND_ATMxLND, J_LND_ATMxLND, AREA_LNDxOCN, DI_LNDxOCN,
        DJ_LNDxOCN, I_LND_LNDxOCN, J_LND_LNDxOCN, I_OCN_LNDxOCN,
        J_OCN_LNDxOCN, xba, yba, xta, yta, AREA_ATM, xbl, ybl, xtl,
        ytl, AREA_LND, AREA_LND_CELL, xto, yto, AREA_OCN</p>

        <p>It is critical that src_grid.nc DO NOT already have any
        of the above new exchange grid fields. If they do, then
        these fields should be removed using netcdf <a href=
        "http://nco.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">tools</a> such
        as ncks.</p>

        <p>After the grid_spec.nc file is generated, it is passed
        into the regrid program through the nml option
        "grid_spec_file".</p>

        <p>The regrid program reads model data from a netcdf file,
        which is specfied by the namelist variable "src_data".
        Again, src_data fields are gridded according to
        src_grid.nc. The number of fields to be regridded is
        specified by num_flds. The name of the fields (e.g., temp,
        salt) to be regridded is specified by the namelist variable
        "fld_name". Each field can be a scalar or vector. If a
        vector, then specify by vector_fld. Vector fields should
        always be paired together (e.g., u,v components to the
        horizontal current). The output file is a netcdf file
        specified by the namelist variable "dst_data".</p>

        <p>The complete namelist option description is available in
        regrid.html or the code itself.</p>

        <p>The diagnostics manager module, <a href=
        "../../shared/diag_manager/diag_manager.html" target=
        "_top"><tt class="filename">diag_manager_mod</tt></a>, is a
        set of simple calls for parallel diagnostics on distributed
        systems. It provides a convenient set of interfaces for
        writing data to disk in <a href=
        "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/" target=
        "_top">NetCDF</a> format. The diagnostics manager is
        packaged with the MOM4 source code. The FMS diagnostic
        manager can handle scalar fields as well as arrays. For
        more information on the diagnostics manager, reference

        <p>In the first section of the field table, the user can
        specify tracers to be used in the simulation. Although
        there is no limit to the number of tracers specified,
        temperature (<tt class="literal">temp</tt>) and salinity
        (<tt class="literal">salt</tt>) must be included. The user
        may also define the horizontal and vertical tracer
        advection schemes. For more information on the field
        manager, reference <a href=
        "../../shared/field_manager/field_manager.html" target=
        "_top">field_manager.html</a>.</p>

        <p>In climate modeling, it is often necessary to allow
        water masses that are separated by land to exchange tracer
        and surface height properties. This situation arises in
        models when the grid mesh is too coarse to resolve narrow
        passageways that in reality provide crucial connections
        between water masses. The cross-land mixing and cross-land
        insertion establishes communication between bodies of water
        separated by land. The communication consists of mixing
        tracers and volume between non-adjacent water columns.
        Momentum is not mixed. The scheme conserves total tracer
        content, total volume, and maintains compatibility between
        the tracer and volume budgets. The grid points where this
        exchange takes place, and the rates of the exchange, are
        specified in the field table.</p>

        <p>For some cases, it is necessary to set a large vertical
        tracer diffusivity at a specified point in the model, say
        next to a river mouth to ensure fresh water is mixed
        vertically. These diffusivities are specified in the field
        table.</p>

        and insertion, please reference <a href="./guide4p0.pdf"

        starting value of the current chunk's dimension range and

        <tt class="filename">mppnccombine</tt> also requires that

        <p>There are several graphical packages available to

        depending on factors, such as the number of dimensions, the
        amount and complexity of options available and the output
        data format. The data will first have to be put into a
        common format that all the packages can read. FMS requires
        the data to be stored in <a href=
        "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/" target=
        "_top">NetCDF</a> format since it is so widely supported
        for scientific visualization. The graphical package is also
        dependent upon the computing environment. For ocean
